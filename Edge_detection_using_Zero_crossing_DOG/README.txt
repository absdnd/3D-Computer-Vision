To use the Code. 

1. Make sure all the python files are in the same folder. 

2. Also make sure the images file is in the same location as the rest of the python files. 

3. Q1a, contains the code to create a Gaussian Kernel.

   Q1b, contains the code to convolve the image with the created Gaussian Kernel. It will show the results 
   from all standard deviations.


3. Q2, contains the code to call for a DOG filter of a given size. It convolves the DOG
