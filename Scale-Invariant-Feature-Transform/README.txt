1. Images2 contains all the sample images being used in the program.

2. functions contains all the functions that are being used in the implementation.

3. The Create_Pyramid_and_locate_maximas function creates a Gaussian and DOG Scale space.
   It also takes the DOG Scale space and display's maxima's at each of the levels obtained.

4. orientation assignment assigns orientation to each of the keypoints in the
   DOG Scale space and displays the output in each scale space image. It also combines 
   all the orientations from different scale space images and displays on the original image

5. Descriptor_specific_keypoints creates a descriptor for all keypoints and obtains in the 
   image and obtains the desriptor for a random keypoint in the image. 

6. The code Feature_Matching matches features between two images and displays the match.

7. Displaying the matches displays the obtained matches in MATLAB. 

##Run each of the codes separately to obtain their output.
